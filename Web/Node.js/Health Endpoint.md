## 📘 What is a Health Endpoint?

A **health endpoint** is a simple API route that reports the operational status of an application or service. It’s often used in production environments for monitoring, load balancers, and orchestration systems like Kubernetes.

Typical purposes:

- **Check if the service is running**
    
- **Report basic system or application info**
    
- **Assist in automated health checks**

## 🛠️ Basic Implementation (Express.js)

```js
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/health', (req, res) => {
  res.status(200).json({
    status: 'UP',
    uptime: process.uptime(),
    timestamp: new Date(),
    message: 'Service is healthy'
  });
});

app.listen(3000, () => console.log('Server running on port 3000'));
```

## 📊 What to Include in a Health Check

- **Status**: e.g., `UP`, `DOWN`
    
- **Uptime**: Time the service has been running
    
- **Timestamp**: Current server time
    
- **Dependencies**: (optional) Status of DB, external APIs, etc.
    
- **Version**: (optional) App version deployed

## 🔍 Example with Dependency Checks

```js
app.get('/health', async (req, res) => {
  const dbStatus = await checkDatabaseConnection(); // Your custom function
  
  res.status(dbStatus ? 200 : 500).json({
    status: dbStatus ? 'UP' : 'DOWN',
    database: dbStatus ? 'Connected' : 'Disconnected',
    uptime: process.uptime(),
    timestamp: new Date(),
  });
});
```

## 📌 Best Practices

- Keep it **fast** — no heavy operations
    
- Avoid returning **sensitive data**
    
- Use **HTTP status codes** properly (`200 OK` for healthy, `500` for unhealthy)
    
- Integrate with monitoring tools (Prometheus, AWS ELB health checks, Kubernetes probes)

## ✅ Summary

- Health endpoints help detect service availability quickly
    
- Keep them lightweight and secure
    
- Can be extended to check dependencies for more detailed reports
